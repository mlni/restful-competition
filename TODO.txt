exercises:

+ cookie test. how much is a + b with a and b being cookies
* session test. how much is a + b with a and b being provided in previous requests
* etag & if-modified-since/if-none-match headers and REST
+ Referer header
* http HEAD with rest resource
* accept: header and different content representations

rest
* content type check
* Range header

+ truncate player log

+ auto-reloading of scores pages
+ kicking users
+ graphing of points

* implement arithmetic tests
* test display of IO exceptions
* add support for stateful tests
* protect poller thread against exception
* replace players atom with ref as it is modified from multiple threads
* add session test
* show whether the user has answered all tests in the current suite

Suites:
1. Warmup
  - What is your name
2. Simple tests
- Arithmetics
- Which number is the largest
- What is the nth number in Fibonacci sequence
- How much is a [+*-] b, a & b in request params
3.Basic HTTP
- User Agent test
- Referer
- How much is a + b, a and b in cookies
4. Stateful test (kui jõuab nii kaugele)
- Restful crud: PUT/GET/DELETE/GET /resource/foo1
- Restful crud with Range headers

Known bugs
* illegal url makes the test loop to die with a stack
